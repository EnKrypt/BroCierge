# BroCierge
Your personal Concierge

BroConcierge is a bot that aims to automate and simplify customer interaction at bars and restaurants without the need for waiters and bartenders.

When you're at the table, use our bot to ask for the menu or have it recommend one based on your taste. BroCierge will add a note to the guys at the kitchen about any allergies you have or your preferences regarding flavor.

Order your favorite meal from last week, or better yet, invite your friend to try it out.

Don't ask for the bill anymore.
Use BroCierge to avoid awkward counting and tallying while splitting the bill. Seamlessly pay online and be on your way.

We won't be able to get you your drink, but feel free to get a feel of our bot at https://m.me/brobarbot

BroCierge was build at [GO-HACK](https://go-hack.hackerearth.com/), we were placed 2nd in the competition.
